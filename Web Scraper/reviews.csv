3,Amazon Customer,"Worst washing machine I have ever seen. I am writing this review after using this machine for quite 2 or 3 months. It is making horrible noise during spin function, you literally have to rush and hold the machine as it's moving so horribly. Please don't buy Samsung products because they don't even bother to solve your issues after calling customer service so many times. The person came and test the machine with 4 clothes even after having 6.5 kg capacity. Then machine did not make noise at that time and they updated the issue as resolved and again same story the other day. Really frustrated with this machine and Samsung service. I have uploaded a video of the spin function making that noise. For reference."

5,K B BHARATI,Dont buy this Washing machine. Service people do not have enough knowledge on the product. It shakes vigorously like a Ghost. You will lose your mental peace with this. I received dented piece first. Later 2nd replaced one is having functional damage. Technicians are unable to repair. After sales service very poor. Please do not get cheated like me. SAMSUNG IS JUST FOR MOBILES NOT WASHING MACHINES.
6,karthikeyan,Worst product. Stops working after 3 months. When claimed for warranty service engineer came and told that board is damaged due to insects. So no warranty. Is customer is responsible for small insects?
